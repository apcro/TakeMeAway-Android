# TakeMeAway Android Client

This repository contains the almost complete source for the TakeMeAway Android app. This code will not actually compile as it is missing some components. In addition, for this code to run you need to have access to a running [TakeMeAway API](https://github.com/apcro/TakeMeAway-Website).

This source code is provided as an example of an Android client implementation for a swipeable travel destination selector, with additional methods around information presentation, hotel selection and the booking user journey.
